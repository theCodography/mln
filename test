Request 3:
All the paths:
 path 1: Start -> A -> B -> C -> G -> End
 path 2: Start -> D -> B -> C -> G -> End
 path 3: Start -> D -> E -> F -> G -> End
 path 4: Start -> D -> H -> I -> End
The Critical path: Start -> D -> H -> I -> End
The Project duration is 19 months
Early Start:
 early start (Start) = month 0
 early start (A) = month 0
 early start (B) = month 5
 early start (C) = month 8
 early start (D) = month 0
 early start (E) = month 5
 early start (F) = month 9
 early start (G) = month 11
 early start (H) = month 5
 early start (I) = month 10
 early start (End) = month 19
Float
 float (Start) = 0 month
 float (A) = 4 months
 float (B) = 3 months
 float (C) = 3 months
 float (D) = 0 month
 float (E) = 2 months
 float (F) = 2 months
 float (G) = 2 months
 float (H) = 0 month
 float (I) = 0 month
 float (End) = 0 month

Request 4:
Solution 1: Fast tracking
 - This solution we can start task G overlaps task C and task F 1 month when task C just completed and start task I overlaps task H 3 months. The project duration will finish 3 months sooner
 - The solution will increase risks of project, need more attention of team members.
Solution 2: Crashing
- This solution need team member overtime or add more people or reward when task G complete 1 month sooner and task I complete 3 months sooner
- The solution will increase more cost of project. But maybe the solution can antiproductive if member overtime too much or new members add to project does not have needed knowledge.
Request 5:
Planned value (PV) = 5000 USD
after 5 months, AC = 6500 USD and 80% scope project is completed
-> Earned Value = 5000 * 80% = 4000
-> CPI = EV / AC = 4000 / 6500 = 0.62
-> SPI = EV / PV = 4000 / 5000 = 0.8
The project is over budget and behind schedule
The project may need to review retrospective to enhance performance of teams, and may review the scope of project.
